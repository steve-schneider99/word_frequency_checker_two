Word Frequency Checker Author: Steve Schneider

Word Frequency Checker is a basic program that will determine how many times a chosen word appears within a specified sentence. The program is also capable of taking a capitalized word and finding non-capitalized versions of it within a sentence and vice versa(i.e. the program will find the word "cats" within the sentence "I Like Cats").
